	<p>Honestly, I guess last year’s SOCIT Fest was more fun than this year. We had a lot of seminars, and just few fun 
		activities. Though I found some seminars helpful for us and I discovered a lot of new technologies. They introduce 
		some competitions that might be helpful in improving skills for some of the students in other courses. Since it is 
	about games, our course couldn’t actually relate to that.</p>
<p>
An organizer from JPCS approached me to ask if I could join the Mr. and Ms. SOCIT on August 16. Unfortunately, I have an 
appointment for my ultrasound on the same day and I couldn’t make it to the SOCIT night. Last year I was a member of JPCS 
organization but now I failed to register. I don’t know if I’m still part of it. Kuya Ivan Jasper suggested that I should 
apply as an officer in JPCS but I don’t want to be so stressed and to have loads of works since I’m a varsity of the 
organization Elite Group of Innovators. </p>
<p>
I could say that the most interesting part of the whole event was the seminar about Introduction to Cognitive Services. 
The speaker demonstrates the Microsoft Hololens. It is a pair of mixed reality smartglasses that was developed by 
Microsoft. It is amazing because it’s my first time to see an actual hologram. I’m looking forward to experience new 
technologies, I guess it’ll be fun.</p>
<p>
All in all, the event was not so fun for me because there’s a bunch of seminars, I’m expecting that there will be events 
like games, karaoke etc. The fun events are at night that’s why I fail to attend those, maybe they could adjust it to 
mornings or afternoon since it is our week, we should have fun and have a break from academics.
