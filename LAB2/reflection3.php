In our third week, we are tasked to create our own website about ourselves. At first, I only know basic codes in HTML and 
from what I learn in the first week. I don’t have any idea with CSS, but while learning, I guess it’s for style. I watched 
YouTube tutorials on how to create a stylish website and follow some of the codes. I never thought that I could create a 
beautiful website by just using HTML, I was amazed and excited on what HTML and CSS have to offer. I made my website 
simple. I just put my picture at the left side, put a background image of nature at the top, button at the right side to 
access my photo, and my self-introduction at the center. As I said in my previous reflection, I’m a fond of simple design. 
I am more attracted to it. But I won’t limit myself in just learning simple things, I want to explore more. </p>
<p>
In our next activity, we are tasked to create a website with Bootstrap and JavaScript. I honestly have no idea what these 
things are but I’m excited to learn about it. At this moment, I’m starting to love HTML and CSS. This will help me a lot 
in our future projects that includes website. I don’t know what else it can do, but I’m looking forward to discovering new 
things. </p>

<p>
I must say I really had fun doing this laboratory activity, I love styling and I am more impressed when I see the result. 
This will be memorable for me as it is my first official website published in the internet.
