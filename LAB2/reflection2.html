	For the second week of our classes, we tackled about need finding and prototype making. From the links Miss Jen 
attached in Trello about Needfinding, I’ve realized that it is essential in making solutions and improving features. 
Yes, miss was right, we should not focus on making the solution without knowing what is really needed. We can’t just jump 
to making solutions without identifying the real problem, it will just end up that the solution is useless. So, through 
Needfinding, the developer should observe or ask for feedbacks from the customers about their product, their needs, what’s 
need to improve or what make its imperfect. After collecting data, the process of Needfinding goes on. First, the 
developers should plan and prepare for possible solutions. Second, watch or ask, and record data about the solution. After 
collecting data, interpret and reframe the solution. Lastly, if everything is clear, developers can now proceed in making 
the solution and implement it.</p>

<p>
In paper prototyping, we had an activity last Thursday about sketching the initial user interface of our project. 
It’s fun to collaborate with teammates knowing they have different ideas in their minds, and we could apply all of it and create a good UI. We plan to make it simple since simple is appealing and avoid crowding words and icons all over the UI. It’s fun to plan, hopefully it’s also fun making the prototype. </p>
