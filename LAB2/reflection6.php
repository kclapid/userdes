<p>
For the first half of our class with Miss Jen, I would say that it is fun learning new stuffs about designing. When I was 
in high school, I only know the basic codes in HTML. During the first half of USERDES, I learned a lot. I never thought 
that HTML can produce such beautiful website. I understand that miss Jen couldn’t teach us every code, syntax, function of 
HTML and CSS and that is okay because it should be self-learned. Rather, she taught us everything about designing, need 
finding, the essence of every aspect of design, right format and the concept of user experience. The challenge for us is 
to apply it in our own website correctly. Also, one of the challenges I encountered in this subject was to learn Bootstrap 
on my own. I have no idea about bootstrap but its our task to learn it. I’ve learned that its for responsive website. When 
miss Jen told us that we should apply Bootstrap and JavaScript in our laboratory 2, I felt problematic at first since I 
never encountered those two languages before. But that’s a good challenge though, and I also enjoyed learning Bootstrap. 
Another challenge was to think of a problem around us for our need finding. Currently, it’s so hard to think of a problem 
that has no existing digital solution. Everything is almost solved by technology. For me that’s the most challenging part 
in the first half of our class.</p>
<p>
My expectation for the finals is that we will be focusing more on accomplishing tasks, since we have to work on our 
website because that will serve as our portfolio. Also, to work on our project since we only have like 4 weeks in finals 
and we have loads of projects in every subject. I hope that we could accomplish our tasks on time and to produce a good 
presentation of our project in USERDES.</p>
