	Hi! I'm Kyla, I’m 19 years old and I live in Taguig with my family. I’m an only child and I’m grateful for that. 
	Both of my parents are working in BGC Taguig and my goal is to work in my dad’s office. My dream is to travel the world to explore different places and cultures and make a video about it. I really haven’t tried going to a place by 
	myself because my parents won’t allow me to. They are very strict, so I can’t travel by myself. I do not also know 
	how to commute and I’m not street smart. Though the most unexpected adventure I had is when my parents allowed me to 
	go to Batangas with my friends. I really had fun because no one’s monitoring me, and I can move freely. We had fun 
	playing cards, drinking, sharing stories, and swimming in the beach. I had the worst sunburn ever, though it’s one 
	of the most fun adventure I had.</p>
	<p>
	I completed freshmen year being an honor student which I’m very happy about it. I made my parents proud and it’s a 
	good start for my college year. I spent this year’s summer by always going out with my family and some of my friends. 
	I also went to school for bootcamp and meetings for our project in upcoming EMERSON competition. I had a busy summer 
	and I’m expecting to become busier in the next summers.</p>
	<p>
	I really had a hard time choosing what course should I take. I love filming and I feel happy about it. It’s my passion.
	I chose computer science because I know I will have a stable career and will have higher salary than filming. Though 
	I also love programming, it’s my second choice. Sometimes when the subject is hard, I’m starting to question myself if 
	I really like what I chose. But I’m still not regretting it.</p>
	<p>
	My expectation for this class is to learn how to create user interface neatly and conveniently. I’m expecting to 
	learn some shortcuts and some smooth animations. I wanted to learn how to contact a station by just clicking a button 
	and how to link an app with a hardware. Since it will help me a lot because we have an upcoming contest in EMERSON 
	where we should create a prototype. It includes mobile application and website. I expect to learn a lot from this class. I hope the lesson not be too fast and the language used is easy to understand.</p>
