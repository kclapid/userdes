Hi! I'm Kyla, I’m 19 years old and I live in Taguig with my family. I’m an only child and I’m grateful for that. 
Both of my parents are working in BGC Taguig and my goal is to work in my dad’s office. 
My dream is to travel the world to explore different places and cultures and make a video about it. 
I really haven’t tried going to a place by myself because my parents won’t allow me to. They are very strict, 
so I can’t travel by myself. I do not also know how to commute and I’m not street smart. 
Though the most unexpected adventure I had is when my parents allowed me to go to Batangas with my friends.
I really had fun because no one’s monitoring me, and I can move freely. We had fun playing cards, drinking,
sharing stories, and swimming in the beach. I had the worst sunburn ever, though it’s one of the most fun adventure I had.</p>
<p>I completed freshmen year being an honor student which I’m very happy about it. I made my parents proud 
and it’s a good start for my college year. I spent this year’s summer by always going out with my family and some of my 
friends. I also went to school for bootcamp and meetings for our project in upcoming EMERSON competition. 
I had a busy summer and I’m expecting to become busier in the next summers.</p>
<p>I really had a hard time choosing what course should I take. I love filming and I feel happy about it. It’s my passion.
I chose computer science because I know I will have a stable career and will have higher salary than filming.
Though I also love programming, it’s my second choice. Sometimes when the subject is hard, I’m starting to question 
myself if I really like what I chose. But I’m still not regretting it.</p>
<p>My expectation for this class is to learn how to create user interface neatly and conveniently. 
I’m expecting to learn some shortcuts and some smooth animations. I wanted to learn how to contact a station 
by just clicking a button and how to link an app with a hardware. Since it will help me a lot because we have 
an upcoming contest in EMERSON where we should create a prototype. It includes mobile application and website. 
I expect to learn a lot from this class. I hope the lesson not be too fast and the language used is easy to understand.
