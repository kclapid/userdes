		I would say that my experience in our first week of USERDES class was great. I like how miss Jen communicates 
		with us to lighten the atmosphere in the class. I didn’t feel nervous or scared because she is very approachable,
		considerate and chill. In that way, I’m more interested in listening. I’ve learned a lot even not during her 
		class, when she tasked us to learn basic web designing using HTML, I eagerly read the book I have about Web 
		Designing given by my previous school. I enjoyed learning, I tried it in notepad, I’m happy when the code works 
		as I see the result in the web, and I want to learn more. </p>

<p>The first lesson we had was about the definition of design. I’ve learned that design is not only the physical feature of
an object or the graphical structure of an app, but it is also how the thing works. Then I searched for the definition 
of ‘design’, and it’s true that it’s also a blueprint or plan. As the discussion goes thru, miss Jen mentioned a lot of
examples regarding the design of an object. She told us about the design of an elevator. I never realized the importance
of the buttons, the LED in each button, and the LCD and voice annunciator to indicate the floors until miss Jen said that 
it is for interaction. I had this reaction in my mind like “oohhh, yeah it is important that the user know that the floor 
is pressed by lighting LED as a response”. Also, that is the only time I knew about the Paternoster elevator that made me 
realized that I should be thankful for our elevators now. It was really hard back then, what if there’s a several people 
in the same floor who wants to hop on, and they all need to do it fast because the elevator is moving continuously. It is 
cool how an object improves as time goes on, discovering new problems and inventing solutions until it will be super 
convenient and makes our lives easier. That’s also one of the aspects of design process, I should think and understand the 
problem, then come up with a solution, for sure I would think of a lot, but I need to analyze and choose the best 
solution. After choosing a solution, I should implement it. Then after some time of executing the solution, I should 
assess or observe to find another problem and continuously maintain and improve my design.</p>
<p>
These are the few things I learned and realized in the first week of our class and I’m excited to learn more about designing. </p>
